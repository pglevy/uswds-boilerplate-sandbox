    The sprawling landscape encompasses lush forests and an abundance of
    wildflowers that bloom year-round. Streams, rivers and waterfalls appear
    along hiking routes that include a segment of the Appalachian Trail.

    World renowned for its diversity of plant and animal life, the beauty of its
    ancient mountains, and the quality of its remnants of Southern Appalachian
    mountain culture, this is America's most visited national park.

    Right now scientists think that we only know about 17 percent of the plants
    and animals that live in the park, or about 17,000 species of a probable
    100,000 different organisms.
